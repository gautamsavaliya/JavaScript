        <!-- WHAT IS HTML-->

        <!-- HTML is the standard markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
             We can display web page content like paragraphs, lists, images, and links in a structured way using HTML.
            We can only define the structure of a website using HTML. For appearance (color, layout, design), we use CSS. Similarly, JavaScript is used for adding functionality to a web page.
            HTML5 is the latest and major HTML version. -->

            What Are HTML Tags? 

            In HTML, there are usually both opening and closing tags. For example, if you use <p> as an opening tag to signify where to start a new paragraph, you have to use a closing tag to signify where that paragraph ends (unless you want your entire page to be contained within one paragraph). To do so, use the same tag with a forward slash placed before it: </p>. 

            What is Attributes?

            Many tags have additional aspects that you can customize. These options are called attributes and are placed after the tag but before the final bracket. Specific attributes for each tag are discussed as we move through the book. But to give you an idea of how attributes work, letâ€™s look at an example using the img tag.

            <img src="mypicture.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A photo of me"/>
            <img>

            In this example, the base tag is img, which tells the browser I want to insert an image at this spot. The attributes are src, width, height, and alt. Each attribute has a value, which comes after an equal sign (=) and is placed within quotation marks.

            <!-- Golden Rules To Remember -->

                <!-- The vast majority of tags must be opened (<tag>) and closed (</tag>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags When using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example:

              
            -->

            <!-- <strong>
                <em>This is really important! 
                    <span>
                    </span>
                </em>
            </strong> -->
