/* Logical Operators

&& (Logical AND)

If both the operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
Ex: (A && B) is true.


|| (Logical OR)
If any of the two operands are non-zero, then the condition becomes true.
Ex: (A || B) is true.


! (Logical NOT)
Reverses the logical state of its operand. If a condition is true, then the Logical NOT operator will make it false.
Ex: ! (A && B) is false.
